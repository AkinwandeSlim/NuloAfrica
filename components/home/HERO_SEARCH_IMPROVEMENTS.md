# Hero & SearchBar Improvements

Summary
-------
This file documents the small, focused accessibility and UX improvements applied to the hero section and search bar.

Files changed
-------------
- `client/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`
  - Reduced hero height from `min-h-screen` to `min-h-[85vh]` so trust indicators and below-the-fold content are visible on most viewports.
  - Marked decorative/background elements and animated decorations with `aria-hidden="true"` so screen readers ignore them.

- `client/components/home/SearchBar.tsx`
  - Added keyboard navigation for suggestions (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Escape).
  - Added ARIA attributes: `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, `aria-selected`.
  - Added a small clear (×) button to reset the location input and focus it.
  - Improved suggestion highlighting and active-index state for screen-reader and keyboard users.

Why these changes
-----------------
- Improve accessibility and keyboard-first navigation.
- Make the hero more professional by reducing height and clearly marking decorative content.
- Improve discoverability of the search input and make interactions predictable.

How to test locally
-------------------
1. From the repository root, start the dev server for the client app:

   cd client
   npm install   # if you haven't installed dependencies
   npm run dev

2. Open the app in a browser (usually http://localhost:3000).

3. On the home page:
   - Confirm the hero looks slightly shorter and trust indicators (if present) are visible below the hero.
   - Tab into the location search input. Type something; suggestions should appear.
   - Use Arrow Down / Arrow Up to move through suggestions. Press Enter to pick a suggestion.
   - Press Escape to close suggestions.
   - Click the small × clear button to clear the input and keep focus in the input.
   - Click "Near Me" to attempt geolocation (browser permission required). Note: reverse-geocoding uses Nominatim and depends on network access.

Notes and caveats
-----------------
- I ran a TypeScript check; it surfaced pre-existing JSX errors in `app/(public)/properties/page_old.tsx`. Those errors are unrelated to these edits. If you see TypeScript or build failures, run `npx tsc` or `npm run build` and check that file for mismatched JSX tags.
- I kept visual styles consistent with existing Tailwind classes used in the repository. No external dependency changes were made.

Next steps (optional)
---------------------
- Debounce the suggestion filtering for performance when suggestions come from an API.
- Add unit or integration tests for keyboard navigation (React Testing Library).
- Add a small ARIA live region announcing suggestion selection for screen readers.

If you'd like, I can implement any of the optional improvements now.
